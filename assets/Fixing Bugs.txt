     Fixing Bugs.
     
     We needed to make sure you can’t drop 2 pieces at the same spot.
     I was able to fix this one. If there is nothing – you can drop a puzzle piece, if there is something already – return first piece.
     
     Another problem was that if you pick new image, board would not reset. I added 
     tray = document.querySelector(".puzzle-pieces")
